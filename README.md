### Site Map & Overview of Portfolio
This portfolio begins with the homehero page that introduces me, displays a preview of my work (with the option to learn more) and has the options to contact me or download a pdf of my resume and cover letter. It then leads to the about page which gives a description of who I am, where I've been and what I do, with an image of me so the prospective employer can see what I look like. Under the description there’s a call to action to view my projects, which leads to the Work page. This page contains my projects and the option to launch them. 

The next page is the blog page, with a preview of the posts and an option to view more. Finally the contact page, where the employer can learn more via Github and Linkedin or they can contact me directly via phone or email.

### Wireframe & Overall Aesthetic of the Website
The aesthetic for my portfolio is clean with a hint of cohesive colour. I chose a minimalistic design of a white background with black text with a decreased opacity so the intensity is minimised and is therefore pleasing to the eyes to read. I chose purple to give my portfolio a pop of colour because it combines the fierceness of red with the calm stability of blue. I then chose a variety of shades to maintain the cohesive design while being interesting from a design perspective.

I used CSS grids and flex box to produce a layout that would suit any device: phone, tablet or desktop. To demonstrate my understanding, I chose to shift the images on each layout depending on what you were using to view my portfolio. For example if you were viewing the homepage using a desktop, you will see every element including the images and the project display would be split into two columns. However if you were viewing it from a tablet or a mobile phone, i chose to hide the images and align the text in the middle for a more seamless experience.

My design for a mobile phone and a tablet are identical so in-order not to repeat myself twice unnecessarily, I chose to use one media query with a max width of 900px and it works great on every device.
