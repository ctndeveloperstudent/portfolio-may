Under the description there’s a call to action to view my projects, which lead to the Work page. This page contains my projects and the option to launch them.

### Wireframe & Overall Aesthetic of the Website
The aesthetic theme for my portfolio is clean with a hint of cohesive colour. I chose a menial design of a white background with black text with a decreased opacity so the intensity is minimised and is therefore pleasing to the eyes to read. I chose purple to give my portfolio a pop of colour that combines the fierceness of red with the calm stability of blue. I then chose a variety of shades to maintain the cohesive design while being interesting from a design perspective.

I used CSS grids and flex box to produce a layout that would suit a phone, a tablet or a desktop. To demonstrate my understanding I chose to shift the images on each layout depending what you were using to view my portfolio. For example if you were viewing the homepage using a desktop, you will see every element including the images and the project display would be split into two columns. However if you were viewing it from a tablet or a mobile phone, i chose to hide the images and align the text in the middle for a more seamless experience.My design for a mobile phone and a tablet are identical so in-order not to repeat myself twice unnecessarily, I chose to use one media query with a max width of 900px and it works great on every device.
